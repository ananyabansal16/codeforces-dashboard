# Contest Table App

## Overview

The **Contest Table App** is a React-based web application that allows users to view a list of coding contests, filter them by various parameters (such as type and phase), and manage their favorites. Users can search for contests by name, filter contests based on type and phase, and navigate through the contests with pagination. The app also includes a feature to mark contests as favorites using interactive star icons.

This app is built using **React**, **Polaris** (Shopify’s design system), and **React Router** for routing. The UI is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search contests by name.
- **Filter by Type**: Filter contests by different types like ICPC, CF, etc.
- **Filter by Phase**: Filter contests based on their current phase (Finished, Before, or Coding).
- **Pagination**: Navigate through the contests with pagination.
- **Favorite Feature**: Mark contests as favorites using star icons (filled or unfilled).
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Shopify Polaris**: A React component library to build the UI with Shopify’s design guidelines.
- **React Router**: For routing between pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
